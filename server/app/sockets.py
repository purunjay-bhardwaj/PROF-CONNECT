# integration (src/api/professorStatus.js) needs no changes.

# ── WebRTC meeting signalling ────────────────────────────────────────────
# One room per meeting_room_id. Both participants (student + professor) join
# the same Socket.IO room keyed by that ID, then exchange SDP offers/answers
# and ICE candidates through the server as a relay. The server never inspects
# the WebRTC payloads — it only fans them out to the other peer in the room.
#
# Flow:
#   1. Both sides emit `meeting:join` → server puts them in room `meeting:<id>`
#      and tells the *other* peer that someone arrived (so they know to initiate).
#   2. The initiator sends `meeting:offer`  → server forwards to the other peer.
#   3. The other peer sends `meeting:answer` → server forwards back.
#   4. Both sides exchange `meeting:ice`    → server forwards each candidate.
#   5. Either side emits `meeting:leave`    → server removes them and notifies
#      the other peer so they can show a "call ended" state.
